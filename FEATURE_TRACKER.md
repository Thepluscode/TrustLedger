# TrustLedger — Feature Tracker

Lifecycle: `PLANNED → IN PROGRESS → DEPLOYED → VERIFIED`.
**VERIFIED** requires evidence (test output / observed behavior), never "it compiles".

Last updated: 2026-06-09

## v1.0 — ledger-first domain spine

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Money value type (BigDecimal scale-4, currency-safe) | **VERIFIED** | `MoneyTest` (5) |
| Double-entry ledger transaction + invariants | **VERIFIED** | `LedgerTransactionTest` (5) |
| Ledger service: transfer / reserve / consume / release / reverse | **VERIFIED** | `LedgerServiceTest` (5) |
| Idempotency (replay + payload-hash conflict) | **VERIFIED** | `IdempotencyServiceTest` (4) |
| Rule-based fraud engine + decision bands | **VERIFIED** | `FraudEngineTest` (6) |
| Transaction state machine | **VERIFIED** | `TransactionStateMachineTest` (4) |
| Transfer orchestration (low/high-risk, hold, approve, reject) | **VERIFIED** | `TransferOrchestratorTest` (8) |
| Audit log + outbox event recording (in-memory) | **VERIFIED** | asserted in orchestrator suite |
| **Whole backend: `mvn test`** | **VERIFIED** | `Tests run: 37, Failures: 0` (2026-06-09) |

## Wiring & infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Evidence / note |
|---------|--------|------|
| Spring Boot context loads (full autoconfig) | **VERIFIED** | `@SpringBootTest` context boots in `PersistentTransferIntegrationTest` |
| JPA persistence + Flyway schema (`V1__initial_schema.sql`) | **VERIFIED** | Flyway migrates + Hibernate `validate` passes against real PG (Testcontainers) |
| Persistent transfer: idempotency + `SELECT FOR UPDATE` row locks | **VERIFIED** | `PersistentTransferService` + 4 Testcontainers tests |
| **No double-spend under concurrency** | **VERIFIED** | `concurrentTransfersNeverDoubleSpend` — 8 racing transfers, exactly 4 succeed, balance floors at 0, ledger debits == money moved |
| REST API (`/api/v1` transfers, ledger, fraud) | IN PROGRESS | controllers stubbed; wire to `PersistentTransferService` + MockMvc test next |
| Persistent hold/reservation + fraud case + approve/reject | IN PROGRESS | request-time hold reserves to pending; `FundReservation`/`FraudCase` rows + approve/reject flow are the next slice |
| Outbox → Kafka/Redpanda publisher | PLANNED | outbox rows persisted in-tx; publisher + Testcontainers-Redpanda test pending |
| Docker Compose stack up | PLANNED | compose files present; not started |
| Next.js operations cockpit | PLANNED | scaffold only; `npm run build` not run |

## Next increments (per the v2.0 build phases)

1. Persist the domain spine (JPA entities + repositories) and prove it with Testcontainers-PostgreSQL — including the concurrent-transfer / no-double-spend stress test.
2. Wire the REST API end-to-end and add `@SpringBootTest` slice tests.
3. Outbox → Redpanda publisher with a replay-safe integration test.
4. Then external payment rail abstraction (`PENDING_UNKNOWN` + reconciliation) — **not before** the in-memory spine is persisted and proven.

## Honest positioning

Not a regulated bank / card issuer / production processor. This is an engineering
baseline that gets the **ledger and fraud spine correct and tested first**, before any
external rails — per the project's own brutal build rule.
